erlang-yahtzee
==============

Yahtzee game written in Erlang.

Why?
=====

- Several Yahtzee scoring calcuations are very elegant with FP and patten matching. For example, in Erlang, a Yahtzee is matched by `[X, X, X, X, X]`.
- I'm working on a framework that is a generalization of ChesSMS for writing SMS games, and I needed some more examples.
